##Capital Cities Quiz

Multiple choice quiz on the capital cities of countries worldwide. Made with
HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, initially while following the [How to Learn JavaScript
Properly](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/) blog
post (before branching off with my own ideas).

Allows selection of regions to be tested on: 
* Asia
* Americas
* Africa
* Europe
* Oceania
Or any combination of the above!

_Coming soon:_ At least 2 difficulty levels, making the answers harder to
guess.

Country info taken from https://github.com/mledoze/countries and
http://www.geonames.org/. Also uses python to combine data from these two
sources.
